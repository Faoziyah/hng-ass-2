Steps to Implement
Use FastAPI or Flask:

FastAPI is preferred for performance and built-in validation.
Flask is also an option for simplicity.
Implement Number Classification:

Check if the number is prime.
Check if the number is perfect (sum of proper divisors equals the number).
Identify special properties like Armstrong numbers.
Calculate digit sum.
Provide a Fun Fact:

Example: Armstrong numbers, primes, perfect numbers, or general math facts.
Handle CORS:

Use fastapi.middleware.cors.CORSMiddleware for FastAPI.
Use flask_cors.CORS for Flask.
Deploy to a Public Endpoint:

Use Railway.app, Render, Fly.io, or Heroku for hosting.
Implement Input Validation:

Ensure only integers are accepted.
Return a 400 Bad Request for invalid input.
